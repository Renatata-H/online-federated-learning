# Online Federated Learning Framework
This is a scientific initiation project with FAPESP funding. You can read more about this [here](https://bv.fapesp.br/pt/bolsas/223950/aprendizado-federado-online-aplicado-em-ciberseguranca/).

The code is not yet finished, and therefore still buggy. But you can run it in your machine if you so wish. 
Tutorial soon.
